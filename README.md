# View Pager Navigation

This is a sample project demonstrating the use of android's Navigation Component to build YouTube style navigation.

As seen in the YouTube app, each navigation page contains its own back stack that is attached to the overall back-nav triggered by the back button. This project demonstrates how this can be acheived.
Here is a [post](https://android.jlelse.eu/instagram-style-navigation-using-navigation-component-854037cf1389) where I explain how it can be achieved, and what we want to achieve is in like the YouTube gif below, and the outcome is represeted in the 2nd and 3rd gifs on the right.
